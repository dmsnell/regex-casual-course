## How not to blow up

This presentation is best viewed in some editor or viewer that formats Markdown documents. The main structure is found in `presentation.md` and the other files supplement the presentation interactively.

Note that GitHub itself is an excellent viewer for the presentation, but it cannot run the interactive bits.

For a great experience, open the folder in Atom with Node 6+ setup and run the code examples with the âŒ˜+I key combination.
